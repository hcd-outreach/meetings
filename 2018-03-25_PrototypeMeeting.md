## Discussion

* Options for round up transactions : 
  * Either Debit card or PayPal, anyway we need to ask the organization to give us the transaction data. -can’t follow banking    transaction ourselves(ilegal)
  * user needs to download some file from their bank regulary(weekly/monthly) -> then we can follow their transaction (just        like Mint in the U.S.) 
      -downside: user has to do something.
  * Paypal (can we get transaction data?)
  * Our app asks users bank to allow us the access to transaction data, and bank app ask user if she will allow this, and we       get the data.
  * we could ask users to manually type in how much they spent. 

* Flow of money
    * Option1. user->retailer->us->we give it to charity (giveback.ie model)
    * Option2. user can directly donate money to charity (like moneybag.) problem -> there might not be no money in user’s account 
    * we should have users to send money to charities themselves. We CANNOT handle the money.
  (How do we have the users to send money to charities?)
  
## Actions  

  * we can make a fake transaction list for prototype. - @Bill
  * come up with prototype ideas with fake transaction list - @Alison
  * NEXT question : even if we DO have a transaction data, and have users make round up, 
  how do we make users to send the money to charity directly?
