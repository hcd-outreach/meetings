## Topics

* We discussed the collective feeling that we didn't know where things were headed following the research.
* We agreed to press on with the tasks identified in class 3 as they appeared to help set the next steps.
* We added a few additional findings to the list of our research output.
* We identified 'gems' in the research and used them to start clusters of cards on Trello.
* We moved (where possible) the research topics into columns representing the most appropriate cluster.
* We reviewed the clusters and consolidated into 6 clusters that we wanted to take forward to 'Insight Statements'
* We gave each of the clusters a headline and agreed to leave the remaining research topics as misc. information.
* We agreed to take one cluster each and write an 'Insight Statement' using the p8 of the class 3 workshop guide as a template.
* We agreed to write the corresponding HMW questions using p10 of the class 3 workshop guide as a template.
* Rather than wait for the call next week, we agreed to review the HMW questions within our smaller groups (based on timezones) to validate them before next week's call.
* Alison and Mickey are off next week and won't be able to make the call.
* We agreed to run the call next week and to record it for Alison and Mickey to re-play.
* We agreed to submit class 2 findings in their current state. These need to be submitted individually but can use material discussed as a group.
* We agreed that we would push ahead with the brainstorming activities via email rather than wait two weeks for the next call.
